  Due to my hosting will be expired soon. My applications, data and configuration on exists host should be migrate. But my migration plan for now is just a traditional method: rent a new VM from my selected vendor, install prerequisite software, config them to be ready for production, migrate data from existing host to a new one.

I tired of doing software installation and edit its configuration files. So, I plan to try Docker on my new host. I thought it should be more easy to migrate next time and I’m a fan of automation process & DevOps. Let try it! My chance has come!

This article is just an introduction to my next articles that about me trying to:

* Dockerize my application
* Wire it up with required components and get it work
* Run it in production environment
